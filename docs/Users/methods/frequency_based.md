3. Frequency Domain Methods

    Fourier Transform-Based Methods:
        Uses Fourier analysis to increase resolution by estimating high-frequency components (which correspond to fine details) in the image.
        Can preserve details but may introduce artifacts if high-frequency components are incorrectly estimated.
    Wavelet Transform-Based Methods:
        Wavelets allow multi-resolution analysis, which can be used to enhance image resolution at different scales.
        Often used in combination with other techniques for better results.
